I submit the following for assessment as my best code.

* The method boardStringToRouteArray in class Tile.
* The method boardStringToPathArray in class Tile.

Together 400 lines of code with two different implementations of depth-first search algorithms which had to take
into account the strict connection rules of the game. Despite being a robust, exhaustive search algorithm, the codes
execute in just a few milliseconds per search.

I declare that this is entirely my own work.
