Review method:getBasicScore which is the task8 in RailroadInk.java
Review Comments:I think this is a very high quality code. 
He and I did not have the same idea at first. 
I thought he would classify the discussion, 
discuss the intermediate overpass, 
each exit and each dead end, 
then analyze the error separately, 
and finally calculate the comprehensive score. 
He used a very good overall idea, 
first created four arrays, 
which are used to store the four factors that calculate the final score, 
which are the exit array, 
the error array, 
the center array and the score array. 
Then he called the transformation method we created earlier to get an array of tiles. 
Finally, using the for loop and the if loop to build a clear score statistics function. 
The overall method construction and variable naming is very clear, 
with excellent readability and easy modification.
