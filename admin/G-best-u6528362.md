I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method isValidPlacementSequence(String boardString) in class RailroadInk().
* The method generateMove(String boardString, String diceRoll) in class RailroadInk().
* The method findValidBoard(String boardString, String diceRoll) in class Tile().

I declare that this is entirely my own work.
